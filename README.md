# Aliexpress Dashboard

As a passionate angler and R coder, I developed a shiny application that displays
in an organized manner URL link for fishing lures found on aliexpress website. 


## Principles behind the dashboard : 

This dashboard displays a table that I created and hosted on googlesheets. 
Any modifications made on this file is automatically transmitted to the shiny application.
By doing this, I just have to use a daily script to update my table on googlesheets 
and have an up-to-date shiny application.

## Live version : 

The live version of the application is available here :
